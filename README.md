# Benchmark Analyzer / Visualizer
A humble tool made in **Python3** to analyze benchmark run times (in ms.) from comma separated value files that generates staticstics (stored in a .json file) and can be read by the visualizer (**HTML/Javascript**) to display plots (and statistics) of these benchmark runs.

**Python3** dependencies (**Analyzer**):
- numpy
- scipy

**Javascript** dependencies (**Visualizer**):
- jQuery
- PlotlyJS

### How to use:
- **Analysis:**
  - **Run** _analyzer/_**_benchmark_analyzer.py_**:
    - _python benchmark_analyzer.py -in "path/to/comma_separated_values_text_file.txt" -out "path/to/output_folder" -op "Operation Name"_
  - **Copy/Move** the content of **_path/to/output_folder_** to **_visualizer/benchmark_data_** folder
  - **Run** _visualizer/benchmark_data/_**_update_operations_indexer.py_** to index the newly added content (this will update _visualizer/benchmark_data/_**_operations_indexer.json_** which is needed in the different visualization modes)

- **Visualization:**
  - **Run** _visualizer/_**_start_local_server.py_**, this will start a local host server at port **8080** (or skip this if you already have the visualizer uploaded to a server)
  - **Open a web browser** (preferably Chrome or Firefox) and go to this address: http://localhost:8080/ (or to the web address where the visualized was uploaded)
  - **You will see 4 different visualization modes:**
    - **Single:** to check a single benchmark statistics, this will display a table of statistics for a specific benchmark run and 3 plots (Histogram, Density (KDE), Box plot)
    - **Multi:** to check a sequence of benchmark statistics, this will display plots (Box plot, Density (KDE)) for the selected benchmarks range
    - **Compare:** to check difference between two selected benchmark runs, this will display a table of statistics for both benchmarks runs and 2 plots (Box plot, Density (KDE))
    - **From File:** Same as **Single** mode but choosing the benchmark from a .json file (generated by the analyzer)

\
The repository contains a **_test_data_** folder with already created input/output data for the analyzer that was added later to **_visualizer/benchmark_data_** folder so you can test the visualization by just starting the local server and accessing the localhost from a web browser (or by directly accessing the web address where the visualizer was uploaded).
